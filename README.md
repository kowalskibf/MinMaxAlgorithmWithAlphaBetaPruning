# MinMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning

Quick task for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" subject.

Most of the code was written by the lab instructor as a base for the assignment.

I only wrote functions:
- evaluate
- winner_or_cant_move
- cant_move
- minimax_a_b
- minimax_a_b_recurr
and main with some low-key additions such as IQs table
